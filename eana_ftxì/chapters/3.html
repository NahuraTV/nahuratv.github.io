        <h1>3: Victimless Verbs</h1>
        <h3 class="subtitle">Intransitive Verbs, “Si” Verbs, -R</h3>
        <h2 id="Transitivity">Transitivity</h2>
        <p>So far, every verb we’ve encountered has been able to take a patient. In other words, they all can be performed on another noun. Just as you can <span class="english_text">ride</span> something in English, you can <span class="navi_text"><span class="stressed">mak</span>to</span> something in Na’vi. But what about a word like <span class="navi_text"><span class="stressed">ha</span>haw</span>? You can’t <span class="english_text">sleep</span> something in English, and Na’vi is the same way. <span class="navi_text"><span class="stressed">ha</span>haw</span> can't take a patient.</p>
        <p>The ability of a verb to have a patient is referred to as “transitivity”, and it’s a big deal in Na’vi. If a verb can have a patient, like <span class="navi_text"><span class="stressed">mak</span>to</span>, it is transitive. If a verb cannot have a patient, like <span class="navi_text"><span class="stressed">ha</span>haw</span>, it is intransitive.</p>
        <p>	In the case of <span class="navi_text"><span class="stressed">ha</span>haw</span>, this shouldn’t seem problematic. Remember that if there is no patient in a sentence, there can also be no agent. Also remember that in addition to the agentive and patientive cases, we also have the subjective case, for nouns that perform an action in general. The simple solution then is to use the subjective case for intransitive verbs, right?</p>
        <table class="side_by_side">
            <tr>
                <td>Na'vi</td>
                <td>English</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="navi_text"><span class="subject">nga</span> <span class="verb"><span class="stressed">ha</span>haw</span></td>
                <td class="english_text"><span class="subject">you</span> <span class="verb">sleep</span></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="navi_text"><span class="verb"><span class="stressed">ha</span>haw</span> <span class="subject"><span class="stressed">o</span>e</span></td>
                <td class="english_text"><span class="subject">I</span> <span class="verb">sleep</span></td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>This works perfectly fine. After all, it wouldn’t make any sense to “sleep something” anyway. However, <span class="navi_text"><span class="stressed">ha</span>haw</span> is an easy example. Unfortunately, not every word that is transitive in English is considered transitive in Na’vi.</p>
        <h2 id="Transitivity in Na'vi">Transitivity in Na'vi</h2>
        <p>In Na’vi, there are a number of words that seem like they should be transitive, but are not. <span class="navi_text">‘eyng</span>, for example, is a verb that is usually translated as <span class="english_text">answer</span> in English. In English, you can <span class="english_text">answer</span> someone, but in Na’vi, you cannot <span class="navi_text">‘eyng</span> someone. <span class="navi_text">‘eyng</span> is intransitive.</p>
        <p>In addition to specific words like this, there is also a very common type of verb that is always intransitive, even when it seems very counterintuitive. These verbs are known as “<span class="navi_text">si</span> verbs”. They are formed by taking other words (usually nouns) and adding the word <span class="navi_text">si</span> after them. For example, <span class="navi_text">kal<span class="stressed">txì</span></span> > <span class="navi_text">kal<span class="stressed">txì</span> si</span>. This makes the word into a related verb. So <span class="navi_text">kal<span class="stressed">txì</span></span> means hello, but <span class="navi_text">kal<span class="stressed">txì</span> si</span> is a verb, usually translated as <span class="english_text">greet</span>. However, much like <span class="navi_text">‘eyng</span>, <span class="navi_text">kal<span class="stressed">txì</span> si</span> is intransitive, and this is true for all <span class="navi_text">si</span> verbs. It is worth noting quickly that you cannot put <span class="navi_text">si</span> on whatever words you want. Only specific words can be used with <span class="navi_text">si</span>, and <span class="navi_text">si</span> verbs are listed in Na’vi dictionaries as separate entries.</p>
        <p>In my opinion, the easiest way to understand these intransitive verbs is to translate them with a helping verb of some kind. For example, I would translate <span class="navi_text">‘eyng</span> as <span class="english_text">give an answer</span>, and <span class="navi_text">kal<span class="stressed">txì</span> si</span> as <span class="english_text">say hello</span>. Now it makes a lot more sense that you can’t <span class="navi_text">‘eyng</span> somebody in Na’vi. You can’t <span class="english_text">give an answer somebody</span> in English either. You have to give an answer <i>to</i> somebody. So, how do we get around this in Na’vi? What is the Na’vi equivalent of this “to”?</p>
        <h2 id="The Dative Case">The Dative Case</h2>
        <p>In the previous chapter I mentioned that Na’vi has five cases, but that we would cover two of them in later chapters. In this chapter, we will cover the fourth case, known as the dative case.</p>
        <p>In English, we form datives by putting the word “to” before them. This can be confusing however, because not every word with “to” before it is dative. This is because, on top of being the dative marker in English, “to” is also the short form of the adposition “towards”.</p>
        <table class="side_by_side">
            <tr>
                <td>Dative</td>
                <td>Not Dative</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="english_text">I speak <b>to you</b></span></td>
                <td class="english_text">I walk <b>to you</b></span></td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>In order to determine whether a word in English is dative or not, a good rule of thumb is to replace “to” with “towards”. If the sentence suddenly sounds weird or different, the word is probably dative.</p>
        <table class="side_by_side">
            <tr>
                <td>Dative</td>
                <td>Not Dative</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="english_text">I speak <b>towards you</b></span></td>
                <td class="english_text">I walk <b>towards you</b></span></td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>You can basically think of the dative as being a noun that is affected by an action, but is not the patient. Not only is this useful for getting around intransitive verbs, it also allows us to form more complex sentences.</p>
        <p>Consider a verb like <span class="navi_text">tìng</span>. Just like <span class="english_text">give</span> in English, <span class="navi_text">tìng</span> is transitive. You can <span class="navi_text">tìng</span> something in Na’vi, like so:</p>
        <table class="side_by_side">
            <tr>
                <td>Na'vi</td>
                <td>English</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="navi_text"><span class="agent">oel</span> <span class="patient"><span class="stressed">tsko</span>ti</span> <span class="verb">tìng</span></td>
                <td class="english_text"><span class="agent">I</span> <span class="verb">give</span> <span class="patient">a bow</span></td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>This is a perfectly grammatical sentence in Na’vi, but it’s a little weird, right? We’d almost never say this without specifying who we’re giving the bow to. Remember that the dative is affected by the action, but is not the patient. In this case, the patient is the bow. We are giving the bow. To specify who we’re giving it to, we can use the dative.</p>
        <p>The rules for marking datives in Na’vi are more complex than the other cases we’ve covered so far. If the word ends in a vowel or dipthong, we add <span class="navi_text">-ru</span>. If it’s a diphthong, we can optionally add <span class="navi_text">-ur</span> instead. If the word ends in a consonant or pseudovowel, we add <span class="navi_text">-ur</span>. If it’s tìftang, we can optionally add <span class="navi_text">-ru</span> instead. <span class="navi_text">-ru</span> can always be simplified to <span class="navi_text">-r</span>, unless the word ends in <span class="navi_text">tì<span class="stressed">ftang</span></span>. Because all of the forms of the dative case ending contain <span class="navi_text">r</span>, we often refer to it as “the -R ending”.</p>
        <table class="side_by_side">
            <tr>
                <td>Word ends with</td>
                <td>-R form</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="navi_text">vowel</span></td>
                <td class="navi_text">-ru, -r</span></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="navi_text">diphthong</span></td>
                <td class="navi_text">-ru, -r, -ur</span></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="navi_text">tì<span class="stressed">ftang</span></span></td>
                <td class="navi_text">-ru, -ur</span></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="navi_text">other consonant, pseudovowel</span></td>
                <td class="navi_text">-ur</span></td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>If this is too difficult to remember, you can choose to only memorize <span class="navi_text">-ru</span> for vowels and diphthongs, and <span class="navi_text">-ur</span> for consonants and pseudovowels. Just be aware that other people may use the exceptions.</p>
        <p>Now that we know how to mark a dative in Na’vi, we can finally tell our imaginary listener who we’re giving the bow to:</p>
        <table class="side_by_side">
            <tr>
                <td>Na'vi</td>
                <td>English</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="navi_text"><span class="agent">oel</span> <span class="patient"><span class="stressed">tsko</span>ti</span> <span class="verb">tìng</span> <span class="dative">ngar</span></td>
                <td class="english_text"><span class="agent">I</span> <span class="verb">give</span> <span class="patient">a bow</span> <span class="dative"> to you</span></td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>And, of course, we can use this to get around the problem of intransitive verbs.</p>
        <table class="side_by_side">
            <tr>
                <td>Na'vi</td>
                <td>English</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="navi_text"><span class="agent"><span class="stressed">o</span>e</span> <span class="dative"><span class="stressed">nga</span>ru</span> <span class="verb">kal<span class="stressed">txì</span> si</span></td>
                <td class="english_text"><span class="agent">I</span> <span class="verb">say hello</span> <span class="dative"> to you</span></td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>Note that in the second sentence, because we do not have a patient, we cannot have an agent, and so <span class="navi_text"><span class="stressed">o</span>e</span> is a subject. Remember that an agent is a noun that is performing an action on another noun. In this case, <span class="navi_text"><span class="stressed">o</span>e</span> isn’t really doing anything directly to <span class="navi_text">nga</span>, <span class="navi_text">nga</span> is just involved. Therefore, <span class="navi_text"><span class="stressed">o</span>e</span> is performing an action in general, and is a subject.</p>
        <p>Don’t worry if it takes a while to understand the dative case, it’s generally considered the most complex case in Na’vi. Because there are so many intransitive verbs in Na’vi, it’s important to learn it early on, even despite its complexity.</p>
        <p>One final note before we finish this chapter: I am again using the formal linguistic terminology for this case. Other documents may refer to the dative case as the “indirect object”. Once again, the names of the cases are largely unimportant, just keep in mind that many other resources may refer to them differently.</p>
