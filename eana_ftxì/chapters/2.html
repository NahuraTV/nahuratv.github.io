        <h2 id="Word Order in English">Word Order in English</h2>
        <table class="side_by_side english_text">
            <tr>
                <td>Jake sees Neytiri.</td>
                <td>Neytiri sees Jake.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>Think about what the sentences above mean. What’s different about them? Any English speaker will know that the difference is the person who’s doing the action. In the first sentence, Jake is doing the seeing, and in the second sentence, it’s Neytiri. To an English speaker, that’s obvious, but what if we were to ask a Na’vi? Let’s translate the words in the above sentence. For now we won't worry about making them grammatically correct.</p>
        <table class="side_by_side navi_text">
            <tr>
                <td>*tsyeyk tse<span class="stressed">'a</span> ney<span class="stressed">ti</span>ri.</td>
                <td>*ney<span class="stressed">ti</span>ri tse<span class="stressed">'a</span> tsyeyk.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>Let’s imagine we give these sentences to a Na’vi speaker, and ask them what the difference is. Strangely, they would tell you that there is none. On top of that, they’d tell you the sentences make no sense; they can’t tell who’s doing what.</p>
        <p>For most languages, word order is extremely important. The order that the parts of a sentence come in tells the listener how the nouns are involved in the sentence. Different languages might use different word orders, but the basic concept remains the same: word order has meaning.</p>
        <h2 id="What About Na'vi?">What About Na’vi?</h2>
        <p>In Na’vi, word order is far less important than it is in most languages. In many cases the words in a sentence can go in any order. Certain types of words do have some restrictions, but there will almost always be multiple options for where a word can go.</p>
        <p>Although this sounds confusing, it also sounds very useful. Imagine how much easier writing songs or poems would be if you could put the words in whatever order you wanted. And if you accidentally missed a word in your sentence, you could simply add it on at the end. Sounds perfect, right?</p>
        <p>It’s a great idea, but there is a slight issue that prevents most languages from doing this. If words can come in any order, we lose the ability to determine who is doing what. If <span class="english_text">Jake sees Neytiri</span>, <span class="english_text">Neytiri sees Jake</span>, or even something like <span class="english_text">sees Jake Neytiri</span> could all mean the same thing, we can’t tell what’s happening anymore.</p>
        <p>One solution to fix this is to give each thing in the sentence a label that tells us what role it’s serving. In Na’vi, we do this by attaching suffixes (extra sounds that are added to the end of a word) that we call case endings. Before we discuss case endings however, we need to know what cases even are.</p>
        <h2 id="Cases">Cases</h2>
        <p>Every sentence in English and Na’vi has a verb, or an “action” that is being discussed. In order to form a complete sentence though, we usually need to add extra information to that verb. It’s not exactly useful for me to simply say, “eating”. <i>Who’s eating? What are they eating?</i> We can make this statement better by adding nouns to introduce more detail; “I’m eating”, or perhaps “I’m eating fish”, is a much more useful thing to say.</p>
        <p>You can think of a verb like a computer with a number of input ports. Some of those ports need to have stuff plugged into them for the verb to work (much like a desktop PC needs a keyboard and mouse plugged in to be useful), while others are simply optional. Notice how I can say “I’m eating”, but not “eating fish”. That first “port” is required, but the second one is optional. These “ports” are a simplified way of understanding cases.</p>
        <p>Cases are basically the roles of an action that a noun can fulfill. Every noun that you use in a complete sentence has a case. These cases can be conveyed through word order, as English usually does, but there are other ways of marking them. In fact, English used to use a different system, and it still contains a remnant of that history.</p>
        <p>Have you ever wondered why “he” and “him” are different? It’s because they have different cases. “He” is used when the person is <i>performing</i> an action. “Him” is used when an action is being performed <i>on the person</i>. If I say something like “him I saw”, you can still tell what I meant, even though the words are out of order, because the pronouns show us their cases.</p>
        <p>We do this in Na’vi as well. Unlike English though, we do this with every noun, not just pronouns. It also serves a much more important purpose in Na’vi, since we can’t rely on word order. In this chapter we will only cover three out of the five Na’vi cases. We will cover the other two in future chapters.</p>
        <h3 id="Subject">Subject</h3>
        <p>The subjective case tells us that the noun is performing an action that is not being done to anything else in the sentence. In other words, it tells us that the noun is performing an action in general. In Na’vi, we don’t mark subjects at all; nouns without case endings are assumed to be in the subjective case. You can think of this as being the “default” case for a noun. Let’s look at some examples:</p>
        <table class="side_by_side">
            <tr>
                <td>Na'vi</td>
                <td>English</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="navi_text"><span class="subject">tsyeyk</span> <span class="verb">tse<span class="stressed">'a</span></span></td>
                <td class="english_text"><span class="subject">Jake</span> <span class="verb">sees</span></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="navi_text"><span class="verb">yom</span> <span class="subject"><span class="stressed">o</span>e</span></td>
                <td class="english_text"><span class="subject">I</span> <span class="verb">eat</span></td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <h3 id="Agent and Patient">Agent and Patient</h3>
        <p>The <i>agentive</i> case tells us that the noun is performing the verb on another noun in the sentence. In Na’vi, we mark agents by adding <span class="navi_text">-l</span> if the word ends in a vowel. If the word ends in anything else, we add <span class="navi_text">-ìl</span> instead. Because all of the forms of the agentive case ending contain <span class="navi_text">l</span>, we often refer to it as “the -L ending”.</p>
        <table class="side_by_side">
            <tr>
                <td>word ends with</td>
                <td>-L form</td>
            </tr>
            <tr class="navi_text">
                <td>vowel</td>
                <td>-l</td>
            </tr>
            <tr class="navi_text">
                <td>other</td>
                <td>-ìl</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>The agentive goes hand-in-hand with the <i>patientive</i> case, which tells us that the verb is happening to the noun. In other words, that the noun is receiving the action from something else in the sentence. In Na’vi we mark patients by adding <span class="navi_text">-t</span> if the word ends in a vowel, <span class="navi_text">ay</span>, or <span class="navi_text">ey</span>. If the word ends in a consonant, pseudovowel, <span class="navi_text">aw</span>, or <span class="navi_text">ew</span>, we add <span class="navi_text">-it</span>. We can also add <span class="navi_text">-ti</span> instead, regardless of what the word ends in. Whether you use <span class="navi_text">-t</span>/<span class="navi_text">-it</span> or <span class="navi_text">-ti</span> depends on what you think flows best for your sentence. Because all of the forms of the patientive case ending contain <span class="navi_text">t</span>, we often refer to it as “the -T ending”.</p>
        <table class="side_by_side">
            <tr>
                <td>word ends with</td>
                <td>-T form</td>
            </tr>
            <tr class="navi_text">
                <td>vowel, ay, ey</td>
                <td>-t, -ti</td>
            </tr>
            <tr class="navi_text">
                <td>aw, ew, consonant, pseudovowel</td>
                <td>-it, -ti</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>It’s important to emphasize that you can only have an agent if you also have a patient, and vice versa. They inherently rely on each other. Let’s look at some examples:</p>
        <table class="side_by_side">
            <tr>
                <td>Na'vi</td>

            </tr>

            </tr>
            <tr>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="navi_text"><span class="verb">yom</span> <span class="patient"><span class="stressed">oe</span>ti</span> <span class="agent">pay<span class="stressed">o</span>angìl</span></td>
                <td class="english_text"><span class="agent">A fish</span> <span class="verb">eats</span> <span class="patient">me</span></td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <div class="note">
            <div class="note_title">Note</div>
            <p>Did you notice that the stress on <span class="navi_text"><span class="stressed">o</span>e</span> becomes strange when a suffix is added to it? There’s no underline on <span class="navi_text">oel</span>, and on <span class="navi_text"><span class="stressed">oe</span>ti</span> the underline covers two vowels. That's because oe is pronounced “<span class="navi_text">we</span>” (Na’vi pronunciation) when a suffix is added to it, making it one syllable! We don’t change the spelling when this happens, but since it is pronounced as one syllable, the stress (and therefore the underline) reflects that.</p>
            <p>Also, take note of the fact that Na’vi doesn’t have “a” or “the”. <span class="navi_text">oel yom payoangti</span> could mean <span class="english_text">I eat a fish</span>, <span class="english_text">I eat the fish</span>, or simply <span class="english_text">I eat fish</span>.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 id="Bringing It All Together">Bringing It All Together</h2>
        <p>The three cases above (subject, agent, patient) are the backbone of all Na’vi sentences. Because word order doesn’t carry any meaning, these cases and the way that we mark them are the only way we can understand the meaning of a sentence. This makes them extremely important to not just learn, but to internalize.</p>
        <p>Having a concept internalized means that your brain processes the information subconsciously, without intentional thought on your part. Having the case endings internalized is very useful, as it means we can make grammatically correct sentences on the fly, and understand Na’vi sentences immediately, without having to think about the case endings. Internalization of any grammar or vocabulary will happen on its own after some time, but there are often tricks we can use to reach that point faster.</p>
        <p>If you read the English word <span class="english_text">he</span> or <span class="english_text">him</span> in a sentence, you immediately think of a man. When you read <span class="english_text">he</span>, you know immediately that the man is doing something. Similarly, when you read <span class="english_text">him</span>, you know that something is happening to the man. You don’t need to think about it to know these things, your brain does it for you. Additionally, if you see a man eating a fish, your brain can tell you immediately that the man should be <span class="english_text">he</span>, because the man is doing an action.</p>
        <p>You can achieve the same effect with Na’vi as well. When you read the word <span class="navi_text">po</span>, don’t just think of a person. Think of a person who is performing a general action. When you read <span class="navi_text">pol</span>, think of a person who is performing an action on something else. And when you read <span class="navi_text"><span class="stressed">po</span>ti</span>, think of a person who is having an action performed on them. And if you see a man eating a fish, tell yourself that the man is <span class="navi_text">pol</span>, and that the fish is <span class="navi_text">pay<span class="stressed">o</span>angti</span>. Thinking of the case endings as meaningful forms of a word, rather than arbitrary rules, will allow your brain to internalize them faster.</p>
        <p>I have one last quick note before we finish this lesson. In this chapter (and the rest of the document), I have used the formal linguistic terminology for the names of the cases. Many resources, however, will use more mainstream terms, which could be confusing. Other resources tend to not have a name for the subjective case. Confusingly, the agentive case is often called the “subject”. The patient is often called the “object”.</p>
        <p>I won’t get into the linguistics of it here, but for various reasons, I do not like calling the agentive case a “subject”, as the agent is more specific than a subject is. And since I’m using the formal terminology for the subjective and agentive cases, I see no reason to use anything else for the other cases.</p>
        <p>In the end, the names of the cases are not very important. As long as you are aware that other documents may name them differently, you shouldn’t need to think about it too much.</p>
